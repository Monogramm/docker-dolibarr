# Contributing

First of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**!

You can report bugs or request new features by creating an [issue](https://github.com/Monogramm/docker-dolibarr/issues), or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Monogramm/docker-dolibarr/pulls) with your contribution.

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews and discussions before maintainers accept and merge your work.

You MUST follow the [Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/). If you don't know about any of them, you should really read the recommendations.

You MUST run the CI test suite and ensure it is successful. If you haven't enabled it on your fork, it will be automatically triggered when opening/pushing a Pull Request (PR).

You SHOULD write documentation.

Please, write [commit messages that make sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
before submitting your Pull Request.

You MUST use the `develop` branch as the base of your Pull Request.

If possible, use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) in your commit message to ease code reviews.

One may ask you to [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) too. This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).

Also, while creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it. If your Pull Request is related to one or several issues, you SHOULD reference them in your PR description. See GitHub documentation on [how to close issues using keywords](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords).

Thank you!
